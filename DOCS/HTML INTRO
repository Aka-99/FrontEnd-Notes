					HTML INTRODUCTION
The HTML stands for  HyperText  Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. You can make your own website using HTML. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript to describe a web page's presentation or appearance and functionality.
 
The term "hypertext" refers to links that connect online pages inside a single website or between websites. Links are an important part of the Internet. HTML annotates text, pictures, and other content for display in a Web browser using "markup." Tags, which are written in angle brackets, separate HTML elements. Tags like <img /> and <input /> insert content into the page immediately. Other tags, such as <p>, surround and offer information about document text, and may comprise sub-elements of other tags. An element's name inside a tag is case insensitive. It can be written in capital, lowercase, or a combination of both. The <title> tag, for example, can be written as <TITLE>, <Title>, or any other variation. However, it is conventional and advised to write tags in lowercase.

Importance in Web development:
1. Structure and Semantics: HTML provides the structure and semantics for web content. Using proper HTML elements, like headings, lists, and semantic tags, makes web content more understandable.

2. Cross-Browser Compatibility:- HTML is supported by all major web browsers, ensuring that web pages look and function consistently across different platforms and devices.

3. Foundation for Web Design:- HTML works in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to control the presentation and layout of web content. CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed, allowing for creative and responsive web design.

4. Integration with Other Technologies:- HTML can be combined with scripting languages like JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages. JavaScript, for instance, can manipulate HTML elements in real time
5. SEO Optimization:-Search engines use HTML markup to understand the content of a web page. Using appropriate HTML tags and attributes can improve a site's search engine ranking.

6. Mobile Compatibility:-HTML5, the latest version of HTML, includes features and APIs that support mobile web development. This is essential in an era where mobile browsing is prevalent.

7. Rich Media Integration:- HTML5 introduced new elements for embedding multimedia content, such as audio and video, without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

Base Tags
As Web developers, we all have to use HTML as our basic language for building the structure of the whole website. More specifically "HTML Tags" play a very vital role in writing efficient HTML programs.
Why HTML tags?
Ok... Before starting with "What?" let's understand "Why?"
Each markup language has its own set of rules for creating, Defining, modifying, displaying & and formatting the block of content on the editor or website. In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses elements & and tags for proper presentation of content as per the requirement of admin & user.
What are HTML tags?
HTML tags are used for defining the blocks of text and assigning formatting. HTML tags are special keyword which is used to wrap the content & apply the rule of specific tag on the whole wrapped content. 
We wrap the block of content using angle brackets: <tag keyword>. Majorly (Not all) tag comes in a pair of opening & closing tag. The closing tag is the same as an opening tag with the addition of a forward slash.
Example: <tag> ... Block of content... </tag>
Some tags don't have any closing tags. <img> tag is one of them as we don't need to define an opening and closing to display an image, just a location of where the image can be found.
Example: <img src="path_of_image">
List of common HTML tags:

 




Container tags:
 
Semantic HTML tags:
 
Empty (Non-Container) Tags:
 




Tags for Table
 
Basic HTML syntax:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Lets learn about Title Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>See above in the Page title bar</h1>
</body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration assists the browser inappropriately interpreting the document by specifying the version of HTML being used. <!DOCTYPE html> in the example above denotes the usage of HTML5.
<Head>
HTML's <head> element is an important component of the document structure; it usually holds links to other resources, metadata, and other important information for the web page that the user cannot see immediately.
<html>
A key component of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the <html> tag, which acts as the root or container for a whole web page. It is a crucial component of the document's structure and indicates the start and finish of the HTML text. 
Title
As a Web Developer, we all have to use HTML as our basic language for building the structure of the whole website. More specifically "HTML Tags" play a very vital role in writing efficient HTML programs. In this article, we will be learning about "Title Tag".  
What is Title Tag?

Content inside <title> tag should consist only text & it is displayed on Browser Title Page Tab.
Note: The <title> tag is required in HTML documents.
The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
Here are some tips for creating good titles:
•	Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles).
•	Search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that.
•	Do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results).
Body
What is <body> tag?
The <body> tag defines the document's/ Webpage body. The body tag contains starting & ending tag.
The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
